<h1 style="font-size: 200%; text-align: center;">Welcome!</h1>

<p>I'm Ariana, still a student who is unsure what to work on.</p>

<p>I've poked into many areas, including Math, Physics, Music, Security and am still actively learning and reading. You can find out more about my repertoire and compositions in the Music tab and the books I'm reading in the Books tab</p>

<p>I'm also looking into some interesting problems in Math, check out the Research tab to see more on these problems and feel free to contact me for discussions if you're interested!</p>

<p>I've also participated in some CTFs, check out these writeups in the Writeups tab.</p>

<p>In the future I may include some interesting topics that I've learnt into a blog.</p>
