# Welcome!

I'm Ariana, currently waiting to enrol into a university and I'm mainly interested in math and music!

I've poked into a few areas, including Math, Physics, Music, Security and am still actively learning and reading. You can find out more about my repertoire and compositions in the Music tab and the books I'm reading in the Books tab

I'm also looking into some interesting problems in Math, check out the Problems tab to see more on these problems and feel free to contact me for discussions if you're interested!

I've also participated in some CTFs, check out these writeups in the Writeups tab.

I've also included some interesting topics that I've learnt in my blogs tab!
