```python
m_1, m_2 = flag[: l // 2], flag[l // 2:]

x, y = bytes_to_long(m_1), bytes_to_long(m_2)

k = '''
000bfdc32162934ad6a054b4b3db8578674e27a165113f8ed018cbe9112
4fbd63144ab6923d107eee2bc0712fcbdb50d96fdf04dd1ba1b69cb1efe

'''.replace('\n', '')

assert((x**2 + 1)*(y**2 + 1) - 2*(x - y)*(x*y - 1) == 4*(int(k, 16) + x*y))
```

We are given the equation

\\[(x^2+1)(y^2+1)-2(x-y)(xy-1)=4(k+xy)\\]

and need to find integer solutions for \\(x,y\\). Since this is a quadratic in both \\(x,y\\), we can easily solve this quadratic for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) as 

\\[x=\frac{2\sqrt k}{y-1}-1\\]

and this tells us that \\(y-1\\) is a factor of \\(2\sqrt k\\). Factoring this in yafu, we can write a quick brute force script to print all possible flags.
