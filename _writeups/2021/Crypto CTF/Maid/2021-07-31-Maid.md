```python
def keygen(nbit):
	while True:
		p, q = [getStrongPrime(nbit) for _ in '01']
		if p % 4 == q % 4 == 3:
			return (p**2)*q, p

def encrypt(m, pubkey):
	if GCD(m, pubkey) != 1 or m >= 2**(2*nbit - 2):
		return None
	return pow(m, 2, pubkey)

def flag_encrypt(flag, p, q):
	m = bytes_to_long(flag)
	assert m < p * q
	return pow(m, 65537, p * q)
```

The cryptosystem here is simply \\(m\mapsto m^2\\) and we also have access to a decryption function that is not given in the code. The idea is we first recover \\(p^2q\\) by taking repeated gcds with \\(m^2\\) and the output of the encryption. Then somehow if we decrypt \\(-1\\), the result is of the form \\(kp+1\\) which makes it extremely easy to solve for \\(p\\), and hence get the flag.

I'm not exactly sure why this works but randomly throwing unexpected inputs sometimes works!
