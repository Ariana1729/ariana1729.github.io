```python
def encrypt(m, pubkey):
	p, u, v, w = pubkey
	assert m < p
	r, s = [getRandomRange(1, p) for _ in '01']
	ca = pow(u, r, p)
	cb = pow(v, s, p)
	cc = m * pow(w, r + s, p) % p
	enc = (ca, cb, cc)
	return enc
```

This cryptosystem uses the following encryption function, which assumes it is difficult to obtain \\(r,s\\) as you need to solve the discrete log. However, the prime is fixed in the server, and when computing the factors of \\(p-1\\), we see lots of small prime factors:

```python
sage: factor(87266586046690087215050730923796275957558114912797348399204944378951121006508714028943628179912845791668792419785918249482052260983866552397369929

2 * 3 * 433 * 13499 * 126517 * 839897 * 858859 * 1349177 * 1984247 * 2191159 * 51063421 * 58465243 * 66744157 * 2269425049 * 4967282609 * 9664300447 * 80875539889 * 154680558367 * 182464819549 * 213517431119 * 439319464013
```

This tells us that the discrete log in this case is actually quite easy and we can easily solve for \\(m\\) by solving for \\(r,s\\) first using discrete log.
