This challenge requires us to send in 6 primes \\(p_i,q_i,i\in\{1,2,3\}\\) such that \\(\left\|\\\{p_iq_i\\\}\right\|=3\\). Then it asks for values \\(e,d\\) such that \\(e,d<(p_i-1)(q_i-1),ed=1\pmod{(p_i-1)(q_i-1)}\\) for all \\(i\\).

In order to find such values, we aim to minimize the LCM of all the \\((p_i-1)(q_i-1)\\) so that we can satisfy the inequality. This is easily done by demanding all the primes to be of the form \\(kN+1\\) where \\(k\\) is small and \\(N\\) is big. Next, we can actually set \\(p_1=q_1=p_2=p_3\\) to minimize the LCM even further. After we are done, we factor \\(LCM\left((p_i-1)(q_i-1)\right)+1\\) in order to find possible values of \\(e,d\\). A precomputed set of coefficients is found in [solve.py](solve.py)
