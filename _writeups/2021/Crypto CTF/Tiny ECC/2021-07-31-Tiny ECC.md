The challenge requires us to enter values \\(a,b,p\\) such that \\(ab\neq0\\), \\(p,2p+1\\) are prime, then asks us to solve the elliptic curve discrete log problem over \\(\mb F_p,\mb F_{2p+1}\\) on the curve \\(y^2=x^3+ax+b\\). However since the check \\(ab\neq0\\) doesn't take mod \\(p,q\\), we can just set \\(a=pq,b=pq\\) such that we end up solving the discrete log problem on \\(y^2=x^3\\), which has a map to \\(\mb F_\cdot^+\\) via \\((x,y)\mapsto x/y\\).
