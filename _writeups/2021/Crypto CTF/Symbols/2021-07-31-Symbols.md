Looking at the image, it looks like some latex output:

![img](Symbols_inv.png){: width="100%" }

and we can copy out the latex as

```tex
\Cap\Cap\Theta\Finv\\{\Pi\ltimes\aleph y\_\wp\infty\therefore\heartsuit\_\Lsh\aleph\Theta\eth\Xi\\}
```
\\[\Cap\Cap\Theta\Finv\\{\Pi\ltimes\aleph y\_\wp\infty\therefore\heartsuit\_\Lsh\aleph\Theta\eth\Xi\\}\\]
and read off the flag
