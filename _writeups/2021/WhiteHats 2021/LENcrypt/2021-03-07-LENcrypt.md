> We modified the encryption algorithm so it will work despite losing the password... Probably.

Files given:
 - [enc.zip](enc.zip)
 - [LENcrypt.py](LENcrypt.py)

The encryption method is pretty simple, convert the plaintext to a number \\(pt\\), find the length \\(\ell\\) of the file, compute the ciphertext \\(ct=pt\cdot\ell\\) and save this as the encrypted file.

Notice that file length, as a mathmatical function, is simply \\(\left\lceil\log_{256}\cdot\right\rceil\\), and since \\(\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)\\), if \\(a=pt\\) and \\(b=\ell=\left\lceil\log_{256}\cdot\right\rceil\\), the file size of the encrypted file, being \\(\log_{256}(ab)\\), is almost the same as the plaintext file as \\(\log_{256}\log_{256}(a)\\) is a very small number.

We can numerically approximate the length of the file with your favourite numerical root finding algorithm, for instance [Newton-Raphson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to roughly \\(\ell\\) an just brute force values near it and check if \\(ct\\) is divisible by \\(\ell\\), if it is, then compute \\(pt=\frac{ct}\ell\\) and save it. With this, we get the flag:
