The challenge name refers to the fact that we're somehow `emulating' the cotangent function in a finite field

## cotangent

In real numbers, this is effectively finding \\(n\\) given \\(\cot\left(n\cot^{-1}(2)\right)=k\\), however, the challenge is in \\(\mb F_p\\)

Consider how cotangent is related to the complex expressions: 

\\[\cot(x)=i\frac{e^{2ix}+1}{e^{2ix}-1}\\]
\\[\cot(nx)=-i\frac{e^{2nix}+1}{e^{2nix}-1\\]

Performing the substitution \\(u=e^{2ix}\\), we get \\(\cot(x)=i\frac{u+1}{u-1}\\) and \\(\cot(nx)=i\frac{u^n+1}{u^n-1}\\)

## \\(i\\) in \\(\mb F_i\\)

Plugging in the values from the challenge, we have \\(2=i(\frac{u+1}{u-1}\\) and \\(c=i\frac{u^n+1}{u^n-1}\\) (where \\(c=0x4e8f206f074f895bde336601f0c8a2e092f944d95b798b01449e9b155b4ce5a5ae93cc9c677ad942c32d374419d5512c\\))

Now we need to somehow express \\(i\\) in \\(\mb F_p\\). Since \\(i=\sqrt{-1}\\), we simply need to find a number such that \\(x^2=p-1 (mod p)\\), which is trivial for \\(p\neq1\pmod8\\)(here \\(p=5\pmod 8\\)). Both solutions would work here.

## solving for \\(u\\), \\(u^n\\) and \\(n\\)

\begin{align\*}
u&=(2+i)/(2-i)\\\\\\\\
c&=i(u^n+1)/(u^n-1)\\\\\\\\
u^n&=(c+i)/(c-i)\\\\\\\\
\end{align\*}

Now it's just a discrete log problem, which takes some time to [solve](solve.sage) (15mins on my old and broken laptop)
