> A group of sheaves of grain stood on end in a field!

The description makes this challenge sound complicated, with abstract algebra and algebraic geometry but the challenge is actually quite simple

## Challenge

The cipher is basically doing \\(c=\frac{k_1}m+k_2\pmod b\\) where these are polynomials instead of integers, however most normal operations works for polynomials.

We are also given a lot of `m,c` pairs, though only `2` was needed

Furthermore everything is done in \\(\mb F_2\\), which simplifies a lot, addition and subtraction are also the same thing which is quite convenient

## Solution

Using `2` pairs of `m,c`, we get(under mod \\(b\\)):

\begin{align\*}
k_2 &= \frac{c_1m_1+c_2m_2}{m_1+m_2}\\\\\\\\
k_1 &= m_1(c_1+k_2)
\end{align\*}

Now using these keys, we can easily retrive the flag
