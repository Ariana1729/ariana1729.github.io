title: Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics Part 1
---

Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SUSYQM) is a method to solve most solvable potentials commonly seen in quanutum mechanics with relative ease. The idea behind this is similar to solving the harmonic oscilator with ladder operators - to factor the Hamiltonian in a day that makes it easy to compute the energy levels and stationary states. 

## Superpotentials

Let \\(\hbar=2m=1\\), the overall goal of SUSYQM is to be able to solve for \\(E_n\\) and \\(\psi_n\\) in the Schrödinger equation:
\\[H\psi=\left(-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V(x)\right)\psi=E\psi\\]

Using a similar idea as the harmonic oscilator solution, let's define the operators \\(A^\pm\\) as
\\[A^\pm=\mp\frac d{dx}+W(x)\\]
where \\(W\\) is known as the **superpotential**. Define the Hamiltonians \\(H^\pm\\) as
\\[H^\pm=A^\mp A^\pm=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+W^2\pm W'=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V^\pm\\]

Let's suppose we are given a Hamiltonian \\(H^-\\) with a ground state \\(\psi_0^-\\), i.e. \\(H^-\psi_0^-=0\\). It turns out with only the ground state information, we can recover \\(V^-\\) and \\(W\\) with
\\[V'=\frac{ {\psi_0^-}\'\'}{\psi_0^-}\quad W=\frac{ {\psi_0^-}'}{\psi_0^-}\\]

Let \\(\psi_n^\pm\\) be the normalizable eigenfunction to \\(H^\pm\\) with eigenvalue \\(E_n^\pm\\), with \\(E_n^\pm\<E_{n+1}^\pm\\). Since by definition \\(H^\pm\\) is a product of conjugates, it is a semi-positive definite operator, so we also have \\(E_n^\pm\geq0\\). 

We have the following way to relate both set of solutions:
\\[H^+\left(A^-\psi_n^-\right)=A^-A^+A^-\psi_n^-A^-H^-\psi_n^-=E_n^-\left(A^-\psi_n^-\right)\\]
\\[H^-\left(A^+\psi_n^+\right)=A^+A^-A^+\psi_n^+A^+H^+\psi_n^+=E_n^+\left(A^+\psi_n^+\right)\\]
Hence as long as \\(A^\pm\psi_n^\pm\\) is renormalizable, it is a eigenfunction of \\(H^\mp\\) with eigenvalue \\(E_n^\pm\\).

The only case when \\(A^\pm\psi_n^\pm\\) is not renormalizable is when it vanishes. By construction we have \\(A^-\psi_0^-=0\\), this yields \\(\psi_0^-\propto e^{-\int Wdx}\\). If we have \\(A^+\psi_0^+=0\\), this implies that \\(\psi_0+\propto e^{\int Wdx}\propto\frac1{\psi_0^-}\\), which is not renormalizable, hence this is not possible and the only nonrenormalizable case is from \\(\psi_0^-=0\\). Hence we obtain
\\[E_{n+1}^-=E_n^+\\]

### Example

Let's consider the simple case where \\(V^-\\) is a infinite square well given by
\\[V^-(x)=\begin{cases}-1&0\<x\<\pi\\\\\infty&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\\]
We have \\(\psi_n^-\propto\sin\left((n+1)x\right)\\) and \\(E_n^-=(n+1)^2-1=n(n+2)\\). Using the result above, we obtain \\(W=-\cot x\\) and \\(V^+=2\csc^2-1\\).

Using the isospectral relations above, the eigenvalues of \\(H^+\\) is given by \\(E_n^+=n(n+2)\\) and eigenfunctions are
\\[\psi_n^+=\left(\frac d{dx}-\cot(x)\right)\sin\left((n+1)x\right)=(n+1)\cos\left((n+1)x\right)-\cot(x)\sin\left((n+1)x\right)\\]

## Shape invariance

 Let's introduce a parameter, \\(a_n\\) into our Hamiltonians, \\(H^-\left(x,a_n\right)\\) and \\(H^+\left(x,a_n\right)\\) where the ground state of \\(H^-\\) has energy \\(0\\) and let's suppose that there exists some function \\(g\\) such that 

\\[H^+\left(x,a_k\right)+g\left(a_k\right)=H^-\left(x,a_{k+1}\right)+g\left(a_{k+1}\right)\\]

If such a function exists, the potentials are shape invariant. We can also see this implies another relationship between the energies, now given by \\(E_n^-\left(a_k\right)\\) and \\(E_n^+\left(a_k\right)\\):

\\[E_n^+\left(a_k\right)+g\left(a_k\right)=E_n^-\left(a_{k+1}\right)+g\left(a_{k+1}\right)\\]

and this also implies that the wave functions \\(\psi_n^-\left(x,a_{k+1}\right)\\) and \\(\psi_n^+\left(x,a_k\right)\\) are equal.

Furthermore, this lets us compute \\(E_n^-\left(a_k\right)\\) with just the function \\(g\\). As an example, we can compute \\(E_2^-\left(a_1\right)\\) with

\\[
\begin{align\*}
    E_2^-\left(a_1\right)&=E_1^+\left(a_1\right)\\\\\\\\
                         &=E_1^-\left(a_2\right)+g\left(a_2\right)-g\left(a_1\right)\\\\\\\\
                         &=E_0^+\left(a_2\right)+g\left(a_2\right)-g\left(a_1\right)\\\\\\\\
                         &=E_0^-\left(a_3\right)+g\left(a_3\right)-g\left(a_2\right)+g\left(a_2\right)-g\left(a_1\right)\\\\\\\\
                         &=g\left(a_3\right)-g\left(a_1\right)\\\\\\\\
\end{align\*}
\\]

More generally, \\(E_n^-\left(a_k\right)=g\left(a_{n+k}\right)-g\left(a_k\right)\\), which is significantly easier than solving the eigenvalue problem.

### Example

The solution to the hydrogen atom can be simplified down to solving the Schrödinger equation for \\(V=-\frac{ke^2}r+\frac{\ell(\ell+1)\hbar^2}{2mr}\\), setting \\(e=k=1\\) as well, we have \\(V=-\frac1r+\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}\\).

Consider the superpotential \\(W(\ell,r)=\frac1{2(\ell+1)}-\frac{\ell+1}r\\), with this, we obtain the following potentials.

\\[V^+=\frac14\left(\frac1{\ell+1}\right)^2-\frac1r+\frac{(\ell+1)(\ell+2)}{r^2}\\]

\\[V^-=\frac14\left(\frac1{\ell+1}\right)^2\underbrace{-\frac1r+\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}}\_{\text{Coulomb potential}}\\]

And we immediately notice the columb potential inside and also the shape invariance with \\(a_n=\ell+n\\) and \\(g\left(a_n\right)=-\frac14\left(\frac1{a_n+1}\right)^2\\). With this, we can easily find the energy levels of the hydrogen atom:

\\[E_n(\ell)=g\left(a_{\ell+n}\right)-g\left(a_\ell\right)-\frac14\left(\frac1{\ell+1}\right)^2=-\frac14\left(\frac1{\ell+n+1}\right)^2+\frac14\left(\frac1{\ell+1}\right)^2-\frac14\left(\frac1{\ell+1}\right)^2=-\frac14\left(\frac1{\ell+n+1}\right)^2\\]
